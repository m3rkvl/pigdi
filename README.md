## Reflection

   I built this app while learning JavaScript. The main app was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann. After I finished coding his design, I added some other functionalities such as a total wins counter, a button to restart the game, a button to restart the round, ability to add and change names, a button for rules and a rules modal. I also made it fully responsive. I didn't try to redesign it from scratch because I liked the design already so I tried to implement the changes I made in a way that compliment the original design.
